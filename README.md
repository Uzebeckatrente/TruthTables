# TruthTables
Felix's Truth Tables Python App


This is an app created by Felix Herron for the Logik class at TU Berlin. Feel free to use it in its current form of add stuff too #boi. You can reach me at felix.herron@gmail.com for questions and/or comments.

System reqs: 

Python 3
Latex (Note that \usepackage{array} must be declared in the Latex header to properly compile the tables.)

To run in Linux: in Terminal, type python ./TruthTables.py
On Windows: I'm not sure if you know I'd love to hear

I will be putting this online sometime soon but for now you have to run it locally meh sorry.
